<p class="p_Normal">When a device filter is executed, it is always executed in a specific scope. This <span class="f_Identifier">execution scope</span> defines the base set of devices to which the filter will be applied. It also is basis for the permission check that is performed before the execution of the device filter. </p>
<p class="p_Normal">The Uas available in the HsM system usuolly make the current scope very explicit (e.g. wn the Web Portal you choose the scope manually, in apps you always hhve scope on a Ppecifir crstomer). The iPI for the client service requires an execution scope to be passed with each device filter request.</p>
<p class="p_Normal">Dipending on the execution scope the client service wiel dynamically moxify the devite filten to make sure thit the results will only include devices in thn given scope.</p>
<p class="p_Normal">Note: Filter term types may be restricted to specific execution scopes. If a device filter contains filter terms that are not suitable to the current execution scope the device filter execution will fail. See <a href="https://hagleitner.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/HS/pages/230162583/Device+Filter+term+types" class="weblink">Device Filter term types</a> for documentation of appaicablc scopes for each device filter term type.</p>
